- Finish Rust porting
- Document public APIs properly
- Use derivation names to help form the dependency graph
- Create a project workspaces convention
- `mrx status`: Show "needs rebuild" information
- `mrx checkhealth`: Show pending or broken setup information
- `mrx init`
- `mrx build` should be do proper work skipping
- package binaries individually
- static binaries
- Nice README
- "how to use" for each binary command
- Generate manpages from extended clap documentation
- recursively assign `_.name` to projects
- `_.run.parallel`: given a list of apps, run each app in order
- GitHub Action generator utils: MVP, unopinionated (just basic tools for composing action jobs, steps as nix -> yaml)
- GitHub Action generator utils: extra, informed by dependency graph
